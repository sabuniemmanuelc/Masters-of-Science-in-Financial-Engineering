This research presents the development of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model tailored for dynamic portfolio allocation in the finance sector, with a focus on integrating risk-aware optimization. Traditional portfolio management methods often struggle to adapt to changing market conditions and effectively manage risk. The proposed approach seeks to address these challenges by incorporating risk management techniques directly into the DRL framework. The research involves creating a novel reward function that balances risk and return, leveraging advanced DRL methodologies like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and applying Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for stock prediction. The model is extensively backtested using historical financial data, with the goal of providing actionable insights for investors and portfolio managers, thereby advancing the application of DRL in risk-aware portfolio management.
